Gabrielle Foreman, et al. “Writing about Slavery/Teaching About Slavery: This Might Help.” Capitalization of \"Indigenous\" appears to be preferred by those from Indigenous communities, for example see https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/writing/inclusive-antiracist-writing/bipoc and https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/indigenous-peoples-terminology-guidelines-for-usage.  As this is a broad term, when possible, one should include the name of the community(ies) or nation(s) of the people in the record. "

  rationale: "This term is used by TRLN; according to our research, this terminology is preferred and widely regarded as a more inclusive term. It is important to include the geographic region in the subject term when possible, as there are Indigenous peoples throughout the world.  When possible, it is respectful to also include the name of the community(ies) or nation(s) of the people in the record, for example \"Chumash,\" \"Tonkawa,\" \"Rapa Nui,\" \"Huetar.\""
